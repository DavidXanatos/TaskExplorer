# System Informer Kernel

- optimizes retrieval of information from the system
- enables broader inspection into the system 
- informs of system activity in realtime
- assists in removal of malware 

## Security 

[Security Policies and Procedures](../SECURITY.md)

Because the information exposed through the driver enables, by design, broader 
access into the system. Access is strictly limited to verified callers. 
Access is restricted based on the state of the calling process. This involves 
signing, privilege, and other state checks. If the client does not meet the 
state requirements they are denied access.

Any binaries built with the intention of loading into System Informer must 
have a `.sig` from the key pair integrated into the build process and driver. 
Or be signed by Microsoft or an anti-malware vendor. Loading of unsigned 
modules will restrict access to the driver. Third-party plugins are supported, 
however when they are loaded access to the driver will be restricted as they 
are not signed.

The driver tracks verified clients, restricts access by other actors on the 
system, and denies access if the process is tampered with. The intention is to 
discourage exploitation of the client when the driver is active. If tampering 
or exploitation is detected the client is denied access.

## Development

Developers may generate their own key pair for use in their environment.

1. execute `tools\CustomSignTool\bin\Release64\CustomSignTool.exe createkeypair kph.key public.key`
2. copy `kph.key` into `tools\CustomSignTool\resources`
3. copy the bytes for `public.key` into the `KphpTrustedPublicKey` array in [verify.c](verify.c)

Once these steps are completed builds of System Informer components will 
generate a `.sig` file next to the output binaries. And the developer built 
driver will use the specified key when doing verification checks. Any plugins
not built through the regular build process must also have their own `.sig`.

Developers may suppress protections and state requirements by changing 
`KPH_PROTECTION_SUPPRESSED` to `1` in [kphapi.h](../kphlib/include/kphapi.h). 
This is necessary if you intend to use a user mode debugger as the protections 
and state requirements will break the debugger.
