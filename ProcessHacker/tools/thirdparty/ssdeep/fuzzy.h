/// (also called the context-triggered piecewise hashes) of
/// \link fuzzy_hash_buf() a buffer
/// of text @endlink,
/// \link fuzzy_hash_filename() the contents of a file on the disk @endlink,

/// an open file handle @endlink .
/// There is also a function to
/// @link fuzzy_compare() compute the
/// similarity between any two fuzzy signatures @endlink.
