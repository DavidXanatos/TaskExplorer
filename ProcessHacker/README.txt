System Informer is a powerful free and open source process viewer.

## Getting started

Simply run SystemInformer.exe to start System Informer. There are two
versions, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64). If you are not sure which
version to use, open Control Panel > System and check the "System
type". You cannot run the 32-bit version of System Informer on a
64-bit system and expect it to work correctly, unlike other programs.

## System requirements

Windows 7 or higher, 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Settings

If you are running System Informer from a USB drive, you may want to
save System Informer's settings there as well. To do this, create a
blank file named "SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml" in the same
directory as SystemInformer.exe. You can do this using Windows Explorer:

1. Make sure "Hide extensions for known file types" is unticked in
   Tools > Folder options > View.
2. Right-click in the folder and choose New > Text Document.
3. Rename the file to SystemInformer.exe.settings.xml (delete the ".txt"
   extension).
